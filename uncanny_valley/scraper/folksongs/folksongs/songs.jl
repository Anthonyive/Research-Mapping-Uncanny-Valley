    "lyric": "(Traditional)\n\nThere were three old gypsies came to our hall door\nThey came brave and boldly-o\nAnd one sang high and the other sang low\nAnd the other sang a raggle taggle gypsy-o\n\nIt was upstairs downstairs the lady went\nPut on her suit of leather-o\nAnd there was a cry from around the door\nShe's away wi' the raggle taggle gypsy-o\n\nIt was late that night when the Lord came in\nEnquiring for his lady-o\nAnd the servant girl she said to the Lord\n\"She's away wi' the raggle taggle gypsy-o\"\n\n\"Then saddle for me my milk white steed\n- my big horse is not speedy-o\nAnd I will ride till I seek my bride\nShe's away wi' the raggle taggle gypsy-o\"\n\nNow he rode East and he rode West\nHe rode North and South also\nUntil he came to a wide open plain\nIt was there that he spied his lady-o\n\n\"How could you leave your goose feather bed\nYour blankeys strewn so comely-o?\nAnd how could you leave your newly wedded Lord\nAll for a raggle taggle gypsy-o?\"\n\n\"What care I for my goose feather bed\nWi' blankets strewn so comely-o?\nTonight I lie in a wide open field\nIn the arms of a raggle taggle gypsy-o\"\n\n\"How could you leave your house and your land?\nHow could you leave your money-o?\nHow could you leave your only wedded Lord\nAll for a raggle taggle gypsy-o?\"\n\n\"What care I for my house and my land?\nWhat care I for my money-o?\nI'd rather have a kiss from the yellow gypsy's lips\nI'm away wi' the raggle taggle gypsy-o!\"\n\n\n\n"

No, child no\nHurry up boys now, don't you be slow\nY'all in a girdle like you was awhile ago\n\nIda Red, Ida Red, I'm plum fool about Ida Red\nIda Red, Ida Red, I'm plum fool about Ida Red\n\nMy old mistress promised me\nThat when she died she'd set me free\nBut she lived so long that her head got bald\nTook the the notion not to die at all\n\nIda Red, Ida Red, I'm plum fool about Ida Red\nIda Red, Ida Red, I'm plum fool about Ida Red\n\nLights grow dim, fire's gettin' low\nSomebody said it's time to go\nI hear a whisper, gentle and light\nDon't forget to come back Saturday night\n\nIda Red, Ida Red, I'm plum fool about Ida Red\nIda Red, Ida Red, I'm plum fool about Ida Red"

I'm the chief of Ulva's isle\nAnd this Lord Ullin's daughter\n\nAnd fast before her father's men\nThree days we've fled together\nFor should he find us in the glen\nMy blood would stain the heather\n\nHis horsemen hard behind us ride\nShould they our steps discover\nThen who will cheer my bonny bride\nWhen they have slain her lover?\"\n\nOutspoke the hardy Highland wight\n\"I'll go, my chief - I'm ready\nIt is not for your silver bright\nBut for your winsome lady\n\nAnd by my word, the bonny bird\nIn danger shall not tarry\nSo, though the waves are raging white\nI'll row you o'er the ferry\"\n\nBy this the storm grew loud apace\nThe water-wraith was shrieking\nAnd in the scowl of heaven each face\nGrew dark as they were speaking\n\nBut still, as wild blew the wind\nAnd as the night grew drearer\nAdown the glen rode armed men\nTheir trampling sounded nearer\n\n\"Oh! Haste thee, haste!\" the lady cries\n\"Though tempests round us gather\nI'll meet the raging of the skies\nBut not an angry father\"\n\nThe boat has left a stormy land\nA stormy sea before her\nWhen oh! Too strong for human hand\nThe tempest gathered o'er her\n\nAnd still they rowed amidst the roar\nOf waters fast prevailing\nLord Ullin reach'd that fatal shore\nHis wrath was chang'd to wailing\n\nSore dismay'd, through storm and shade\nHis child he did discover\nOne lovely hand she stretch'd for aid\nAnd one was round her lover\n\n\"Come back! Come back!\", he cried in grief\n\"Across this stormy water\nAnd I'll forgive your Highland chief\nMy daughter! -oh, my daughter!\"\n\n'Twas vain: the loud waves lash'd the shore\nReturn or aid preventing\nThe waters wild went o'er his child\nAnd he was left lamenting"

    "lyric": "Jesse James was a lad that killed many a man\nHe robbed the Danville train\nHe stole from the rich and he gave to the poor\nHe'd a hand, a heart, and a brain\n\nJesse was a man, a friend to the poor\nHe couldn't see a brother suffer pain\nAnd with his brother Frank he robbed the Springfield bank\nAnd he stopped the Glendale train\n\nPoor Jesse had a wife, a lady all her life\nAnd three children, they were so brave\nBut that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard\nHas laid ol' Jesse James in his grave\n\nIt was Robert Ford, the dirty little coward\nAnd I wonder how he feels\nFor he slept in Jesse's bed and he ate o' Jesse's bread\nBut he laid Jesse James in his grave \n\nIt was with his brother Frank that he robbed the Gallatin Bank\nAn' carried the money from the town\nIt was at that very place that they had a little chase\nFor they shot ol' Captain Sheets to the ground\n\nPoor Jesse had a wife to morn for his life\nAnd three children, they were so brave\nBut that dirty lettle coward that shot Mr. Joward\nHas laid ol' Jesse James in his grave \n\nThey went to a crossing, not very far from there\nAnd there they did the same \nFor the agent on his knees delivered up the keys\nTo the outlaws, Frank an' Jesse James \n\nIt was on a Wednesday night, not a star was in sight\nWhen they robbed the Glendale train\nThose people, they did say for many miles away\nIt was robbed by Frank an' Jesse James \n\nPoor Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life\nAnd three children, they were so brave\nBut that dirty lettle coward that shot Mr. Joward\nHas laid ol' Jesse James in his grave \n\nThen on a Saturday night, Jesse was at home\nJust talking with his family brave\nWhen Robert Ford came along like a thief in the night\nAnd laid poor Jesse in his grave\n\nNow, the people held their breath when they heard of Jesse's death\nThey wondered how he came to die\nIt was one of his own gang called little Robert Ford\nAn' he shot Jesse James on the sly\n\nPoor Jesse had a wife who mourned for his life\nAnd three children, they were so brave\nBut that dirty lettle coward that shot Mr. Joward\nHas laid ol' Jesse James in his grave\n\nJesse went to his rest with his hand upon his breast\nAnd there are many who never saw his face\nHe was born one day in the County of Clay\nAnd he came from a solitary race\n\nThis song was made by Billy Gashade\nAs soon as the news did arrive\nHe said there's no one man with the law in his hand\nCould ever take ol' Jesse James alive \n\nPoor Jesse had a wife to mourn his life\nAn' his children too, they were brave\nBut that dirty little coward shot Mr. Howard\nAn' laid Jesse James in his grave\n\nOh, they laid poor Jesse in his grave, yes, Lord\nThey laid Jesse James in his grave\nOh, he took from the rich and he gave to the poor\nBut, they laid Jesse James in his grave"

    "lyric": "Arranged and adapted by Arlo Guthrie\n\nSo you ask me my kind friend\nWhy I am sad and still\nAnd why my brow is darkened\nLike the clouds upon the hill\n\nRein in your ponies closer\nAnd I'll tell you all a tale\nOf Utah Carroll, partner\nAnd his last ride on the trail\n\nIn a grave without a headstone\nWithout a date or name\nMy partner lies there silent\nIn the land from which I came\n\nLong ago we rode together\nWe'd ridden side by side\nI loved him like a brother\nAnd I wept when Utah died\n\nWhile riding up one morning\nAnd our work was almost done\nThe cattle quickly started\nOn a wild and maddening run\n\nThe boss's little daughter\nWho was riding on that side\nRushed in to stop the stampede\nIt was there my partner died\n\nLenore upon her pony\nTried to turn the cattle right\nBut her blanket slipped beneath her\nAnd she caught and held on tight\n\nWhen we all saw that red blanket\nEach cowboy held his breath\nFor should her pony fail her\nNone could save the girl from death\n\nWhen the cattle saw the blanket\nAlmost dragging on the ground\nThey were maddened in a moment\nAnd they charged with deafening sound\n\nThe girl soon saw her danger\nAnd she turned her pony's face\nAnd bending in her saddle\nTried the blanket to replace\n\nJust then she lost her balance\nIn the front of that wild tide\nCarroll's voice controlled the round up\n\"Lie still, Lenore\" he cried\n\nAnd then close up beside her\nCame Utah riding fast\nBut little did the poor boy know\nThe ride would be his last\n\nFull often from the saddle\nHe had caught the trailing rope\nTo pick her up at full speed\nWas now his only hope\n\nHe swung low from his saddle\nTo take her to his arm\nWe thought that he'd succeeded\nThat the girl was safe from harm\n\nBut such a strain upon his saddle\nHad ne'er been put before\nAnd the cinches gave beneath him\nAnd he fell beside Lenore\n\nWhen the girl fell from her saddle\nShe had dragged the blanket down\nIt lay there close beside them\nWhere they lay upon the ground\n\nUtah took the blanket\nAnd to Lenore he said\n\"Lie still\" and quickly running\nWaved the red thing o'er his head\n\nHe turned the maddened cattle\nFrom Lenore, his little friend\nAnd as the mighty herd rushed toward him\nHe turned to met his end\n\nAnd as the herd came on him\nHis weapon quickly drew\nHe was bound to die defended\nAs all brave cowboys do\n\nThe weapon flashed like lightning\nAnd it sounded loud and clear\nAs the cattle rushed and killed him\nHe dropped the leading steer\n\nWhen I broke through that wide circle\nTo where poor Utah lay\nWith a thousand wounds and bruises\nHis life blood ebbed away\n\nI knelt down close beside him\nAnd I knew that all was o'er\nAs I heard him faintly whisper\n\"Good-bye, my sweet Lenore\"\n\nNext morning at the churchyard\nI heard the preacher say\n\"Don't think our kind friend Utah\nWas lost on that great day\n\nHe was a much-loved cowboy\nAnd not afraid to die\nAnd we'll meet him at the round up\nOn the plains beyond the sky\"\n\nSo you ask me my kind friend\nWhy I am sad and still\nAnd why my brow is darkened\nLike the clouds upon the hill\n\nRein in your ponies closer\nAnd I'll tell you all a tale\nOf Utah Carroll, partner\nAnd his last ride on the trail\n\n\n\n"

    "lyric": "The King sits in Dunfirmline town, \nDrinking of the blood-red wine\n\"Where can I get a steely skipper \nTo sail this might boat of mine?\"\n\nThen up there spoke a bonny boy, \nSitting at the King's right knee\n\"Sir Patrick Spens is the very best seaman \nThat ever sailed upon the sea\"\n\nThe King has written a broad letter \nAnd sealed it up with his own right hand\nSending word unto Sir Patrick to come to him at his command\n\n\"An enemy then this must be \nWho told the lie concerning me\nFor I was never a very good seaman, \nNor ever do intend to be\"\n\n\"Last night I saw the new moon clear \nWith the new moon in her hair\nAnd that is a sign since we were born \nThat means there'll be a deadly storm\"\n\nThey had not sailed upon the deep a day, \nA day but barely free\nWhen loud and boisterous blew the winds \nAnd loud and noisy blew the sea\n\nThen up there came a mermaiden, \nA comb and glass all in her hand\n\"Here's to you my merry young men for you'll not see dry land again\"\n\n\"Long may my lady stand \nQith a lantern in her hand\nBefore she sees my bonny ship \nCome sailing homeward to dry land\"\n\nForty miles off Aberdeen, \nThe waters fifty fathoms deep\nThere lies good Sir Patrick Spens \nWith the Scots lords at his feet"
