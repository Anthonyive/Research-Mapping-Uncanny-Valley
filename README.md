This is an amazing research project from [Professor Keith](https://www.isi.edu/people/keithab/about).

### System and package information
Dealing with tensorflow gpu can be a little bit tricky, so I included [system information](hardinfo.txt), [apt packages installation information](packinfo.txt), and [python packages information](Pipfile).

## Overview
- “Nearly-human” creatures persist in stories across cultures
    - Why are creepy stories filled with almost-human ghosts, zombies, and cryptids?
    - Do popular stories reach a creepy “sweet spot” in which creatures or scenarios are nearly-normal but not quite?
- Goal: help answer what makes text creepy
    - Learn and apply skills of natural language processing
    - Learn what to avoid for AI design and human-computer interaction
    - Understand the psychology of humans: why are creatures or scenarios scary?
