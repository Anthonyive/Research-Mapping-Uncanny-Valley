Ashliman\\'s folktexts, a library of folktales, folklore, \\nfairy tales, and mythology.\\n\\nThe Recovered Bride\\nIreland\\nThere was a marriage in the townland of Curragraigue. After the usual\\nfestivities, and when the guests were left to themselves, and were\\ndrinking to the prosperity of the bride and bridegroom, they were startled\\nby the appearance of the man himself rushing into the room with anguish in\\nhis looks.\\n\"Oh!\" cried he, \"Margaret is carried away by the fairies, I\\'m sure. The\\ngirls were not left the room for half a minute when I went in, and there\\nis no more sign of her there than if she never was born.\"\\nGreat consternation prevailed, great search was made, but no Margaret\\nwas to be found. After a night and day spent in misery, the poor\\nbridegroom laid down to take some rest. In a while he seemed to himself to\\nawake from a troubled dream, and look out into the room. The moon was\\nshining in through the window, and in the middle of the slanting rays\\nstood Margaret in her white bridal clothes. He thought to speak and leap\\nout of the bed, but his tongue was without utterance, and his limbs unable\\nto move.\\n\"Do not be disturbed, dear husband,\" said the appearance; \"I am now in\\nthe power of the fairies, but if you only have courage and prudence we may\\nbe soon happy with each other again. Next Friday will be May-eve, and the\\nwhole court will ride out of the old fort after midnight. I must be there\\nalong with the rest. Sprinkle a circle with holy water, and have a\\nblack-hafted knife with you. If you have courage to pull me off the horse,\\nand draw me into the ring, all they can do will be useless. You must have\\nsome food for me every night on the dresser, for if I taste one mouthful\\nwith them, I will be lost to you forever. The fairies got power over me\\nbecause I was only thinking of you, and did not prepare myself as I ought\\nfor the sacrament. I made a bad confession, and now I am suffering for it.\\nDon\\'t forget what I have said.\"\\n\"Oh, no, my darling,\" cried he, recovering his speech, but by the time\\nhe had slipped out of bed, there was no living soul in the room but\\nhimself.\\nTill Friday night the poor young husband spent a desolate time. The\\nfood was left on the dresser over night, and it rejoiced all hearts to\\nfind it vanished by morning. A little before midnight he was at the\\nentrance of the old rath. He formed the circle, took his station within\\nit, and kept the black-hafted knife ready for service. At times he was\\nnervously afraid of losing his dear wife, and at others burning with\\nimpatience for the struggle.\\nAt last the old fort with its dark high bushy fences cutting against\\nthe sky, was in a moment replaced by a palace and its court. A thousand\\nlights flashed from the windows and lofty hall entrance; numerous torches\\nwere brandished by attendants stationed round the courtyard; and a\\nnumerous cavalcade of richly attired ladies and gentlemen was moving in\\nthe direction of the gate where he found himself standing.\\nAs they rode by him laughing and jesting, he could not tell whether\\nthey were aware of his presence or not. He looked intent at each\\ncountenance as it approached, but it was some time before he caught sight\\nof the dear face and figure borne along on a milk-white steed. She\\nrecognized him well enough, and her features now broke into a smile -- now\\nexpressed deep anxiety.\\nShe was unable for the throng to guide the animal close to the ring of\\npower; so he suddenly rushed out of his bounds, seized her in his arms,\\nand lifted her off. Cries of rage and fury arose on every side; they were\\nhemmed in, and weapons were directed at his head and breast to terrify\\nhim. He seemed to be inspired with superhuman courage and force, and\\nwielding the powerful knife he soon cleared a space round him, all seeming\\ndismayed by the sight of the weapon. He lost no time, but drew his wife\\nwithin the ring, within which none of the myriads round dared to enter.\\nShouts of derision and defiance continued to fill the air for some time,\\nbut the expedition could not be delayed.\\nAs the end of the procession filed past the gate and the circle within\\nwhich the mortal pair held each other determinedly clasped, darkness and\\nsilence fell on the old rath and the fields round it, and the rescued\\nbride and her lover breathed freely. We will not detain the sensitive\\nreader on the happy walk home, on the joy that hailed their arrival, and\\non all the eager gossip that occupied the townland and the five that\\nsurround it for a month after the happy rescue.\\n\\n',\n",

I suppose I was no more than twelve years of age at\\nthe time. \\'Twas a very out of the way place and mountainy. \\n\\nWell, not far from my master\\'s house there was a family of the Brogans.\\n\\'Twas the will of God that Mrs. Brogan took sick, and there was a baby\\nborn, but the poor woman died. Well, the sister, a younger girl than the\\nwoman that died, came to nurse the child. After some time she began to\\nlook very delicate and uneasy. The naghbours were beginning to talk amongs\\nthemselves about her, and it came to Brogan\\'s ears, and, begor, it made\\nhim vexed. So he asked the sister what was up with her.\\n\\n\"Well, John,\" says she, \"I did not like to tell you, but Ellie\" -- that\\nwas the name of the dead woman -- \"comes every night, and takes the baby\\nand nurses it, and goes away without a word.\"\\n\\n\"By my word,\" says John, \"she is not dead at all, but taken, and I will\\nwatch her to-night.\"\\n\\nGood enough, he remained up, and about 12 o\\'clock in she came, and he put\\nhis arms around her, but as he said, felt no substance.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t keep me now,\" says she, \"for I\\'m married agin; but if you come\\nto the Bottle Hill field to-morrow night, there will be about 40 of us\\ngoin\\' t\\'words Blarney, and we will all be on horses, with our husbands.\\nAll the horses will be white, and I and my man will be last. Bring a hazel\\nstick woud [with] you and strike the horse on the right side, and I will\\nfall off. Just as I fall, ketch me with all your might. You will know my\\nman, for he is the only one of them that has a red head.\"\\n\\nWell, he went, and he must have a great heart, for on they come, gallopin\\'\\nlike mad. Just as the man with the red head\\'s horse came he stood one-side\\nand struck. She fell and he gripped her like iron. Well, such a hullabaloo\\nas there was, was never heard, and all the other men makin\\' game of the\\nred-headed man.\\n\\nWell, he brought her home, and they lived for years after, and had a good\\nfamily, and were the happiest people around the place. I often see some of\\nher children; of course they are all married now, and gone here and there,\\nbut that\\'s as true as my name is Tim Brosnan. \\n\\n',\n",

Jamie was the widow\\'s sole support; his strong arm worked for her untiringly, and as each Saturday night came round, he poured his wages into her lap, thanking her dutifully for the halfpence which she returned him for tobacco.\\n \\nHe was extolled by his neighbours as the best son ever known or heard of. But he had neighbours, of whose opinion he was ignorant -- neighbours who lived pretty close to him, whom he had never seen, who are, indeed, rarely seen by mortals, except on May eves and Halloweens.\\n \\nAn old ruined castle, about a quarter of a mile from his cabin, was said to be the abode of the \"wee folk.\" Every Halloween were the ancient windows lighted up, and passers-by saw little figures flitting to and fro inside the building, while they heard the music of pipes and flutes.\\n \\nIt was well known that fairy revels took place; but nobody had the courage to intrude on them.\\n \\nJamie had often watched the little figures from a distance, and listened to the charming music, wondering what the inside of the castle was like; but one Halloween he got up and took his cap, saying to his mother, \"I\\'m awa\\' to the castle to seek my fortune.\"\\n \\n\"What!\" cried she, \"would you venture there? you that\\'s the poor widow\\'s one son! Dinna be sae venturesome an\\' foolitch, Jamie! They\\'ll kill you, an\\' then what\\'ll come o\\' me?\"\\n \\n\"Never fear, mother; nae harm \\'ill happen me, but I maun gae.\"\\n \\nHe set out, and as he crossed the potato field, came in sight of the castle, whose windows were ablaze with light, that seemed to turn the russet leaves, still clinging to the crab tree branches, into gold.\\n \\nHalting in the grove at one side of the ruin, he listened to the elfin revelry, and the laughter and singing made him all the more determined to proceed.\\n \\nNumbers of little people, the largest about the size of a child of five years old, were dancing to the music of flutes and fiddles, while others drank and feasted.\\n \\n\"Welcome, Jamie Freel! welcome, welcome, Jamie!\" cried the company, perceiving their visitor. The word \"Welcome\" was caught up and repeated by every voice in the castle.\\n \\nTime flew, and Jamie was enjoying himself very much, when his hosts said, \"We\\'re going to ride to Dublin tonight to steal a young lady. Will you come too, Jamie Freel?\"\\n \\n\"Ay, that will I!\" cried the rash youth, thirsting for adventure.\\n \\nA troop of horses stood at the door. Jamie mounted, and his steed rose with him into the air. He was presently flying over his mother\\'s cottage, surrounded by the elfin troop, and on and on they went, over bold mountains, over little hills, over the deep Lough Swilley, over towns and cottages, when people were burning nuts, and eating apples, and keeping merry Halloween. It seemed to Jamie that they flew all round Ireland before they got to Dublin.\\n \\n\"This is Derry,\" said the fairies, flying over the cathedral spire; and what was said by one voice was repeated by all the rest, till fifty little voices were crying out, \"Deny! Derry! Derry!\" \\n \\nIn like manner was Jamie informed as they passed over each town on the rout, and at length he heard the silvery voices cry, \"Dublin! Dublin!\"\\n \\nIt was no mean dwelling that was to be honoured by the fairy visit, but one of the finest houses in Stephen\\'s Green.\\n \\nThe troop dismounted near a window, and Jamie saw a beautiful face, on a pillow in a splendid bed. He saw the young lady lifted and carried away, while the stick which was dropped in her place on the bed took her exact form.\\n \\nThe lady was placed before one rider and carried a short way, then given another, and the names of the towns were cried out as before.\\n \\nThey were approaching home. Jamie heard \"Rathmullan,\" \"Milford,\" \"Tamney,\" and then he knew they were near his own house.\\n \\n\"You\\'ve all had your turn at carrying the young lady,\" said he. \"Why wouldn\\'t I get her for a wee piece?\"\\n \\n\"Ay, Jamie,\" replied they, pleasantly, \"you may take your turn at carrying her, to be sure.\"\\n \\nHolding his prize very tightly, he dropped down near his mother\\'s door.\\n \\n\"Jamie Freel, Jamie Freel! is that the way you treat us?\" cried they, and they too dropped down near the door.\\n \\nJamie held fast, though he knew not what he was holding, for the little folk turned the lady into all sorts of strange shapes. At one moment she was a black dog, barking and trying to bite; at another, a glowing bar of iron, which yet had no heat; then, again, a sack of wool.\\n \\nBut still Jamie held her, and the baffled elves were turning away, when a tiny woman, the smallest of the party, exclaimed, \"Jamie Freel has her awa\\' frae us, but he sall hae nae gude o\\' her, for I\\'ll mak\\' her deaf and dumb,\" and she threw something over the young girl.\\n \\nWhile they rode off disappointed, Jamie lifted the latch and went in.\\n \\n\"Jamie, man!\" cried \"his mother, \"you\\'ve been awa\\' all night; what have they done on you?\"\\n \\n\"Naething bad, mother; I ha\\' the very best of gude luck. Here\\'s a beautiful young lady I ha\\' brought you for company.\\n \\n\"Bless us an\\' save us!\" exclaimed the mother, and for some minutes she was so astonished that she could not think of anything else to say.\\n \\nJamie told his story of the night\\'s adventure, ending, by saying, \"Surely you wouldna have allowed me to let her gang with them to be lost forever?\"\\n \\n\"But a lady, Jamie! How can a lady eat we\\'er poor diet, and live in we\\'er poor way? I ax you that, you foolitch fellow?\"\\n \\n\"Weel, mother, sure it\\'s better for her to be here nor over yonder,\" and he pointed in the direction of the castle.\\n \\nMeanwhile, the deaf and dumb girl shivered in her light clothing, stepping close to the humble turf fire.\\n \\n\"Poor crathur, she\\'s quare and handsome! Nae wonder they set their hearts on her,\" said the old woman, gazing at her guest with pity and admiration. \"We maun dress her first; but what, in the name o\\' fortune, hae I fit for the likes o\\' her to wear?\"\\n \\nShe went to her press in \"the room,\" and took out her Sunday gown of brown drugget; she then opened a drawer, and drew forth a pair of white stockings, a long snowy garment of fine linen, and a cap, her \"dead dress,\" as she called it.\\n \\nThese articles of attire had long been ready for a certain triste ceremony, in which she would some day fill the chief part, and only saw the light occasionally, when they were hung out to air; but she was willing to give even these to the fair trembling visitor, who was turning in dumb sorrow and wonder from her to Jamie, and from Jamie back to her.\\n \\nThe poor girl suffered herself to be dressed, and then sat down on a \"creepie\" in the chimney corner, and buried her face in her hands.\\n \\n\"What\\'ll we do to keep up a lady like thou?\" cried the old woman.\\n \\n\"I\\'ll work for you both, mother,\" replied the son.\\n \\n\"An\\' how could a lady live on we\\'er poor diet?\" she repeated.\\n \\n\"I\\'ll work for her,\" was all Jamie\\'s answer.\\n \\nHe kept his word. The young lady was very sad for a long time, and tears stole down her cheeks many an evening while the old woman spun by the fire, and Jamie made salmon nets, an accomplishment lately acquired by him, in hopes of adding to the comfort of his guest. \\n \\nBut she was always gentle, and tried to smile when she perceived them looking at her; and by degrees she adapted herself to their ways and mode of life. It was not very long before she began to feed the pig, mash potatoes and meal for the fowls, and knit blue worsted socks.\\n \\nSo a year passed, and Halloween came round again. \"Mother,\" said Jamie, taking down his cap, \"I\\'m off to the ould castle to seek my fortune.\"\\n \\n\"Are you mad, Jamie?\" cried his mother, in terror; \"sure they\\'ll kill you this time for what you done on them last year.\"\\n \\nJamie made light of her fears and went his way.\\n \\nAs he reached the crab tree grove, he saw bright lights in the castle windows as before, and heard loud talking. Creeping under the window, he heard the wee folk say, \"That was a poor trick Jamie Freel played us this night last year, when he stole the nice young lady from us.\"\\n \\n\"Ay,\" said the tiny woman, \"an\\' I punished him for it, for there she sits, a dumb image by his hearth; but he does na\\' know that three drops out o\\' this glass I hold in my hand wad gie her her hearing and her speeches back again.\"\\n \\nJamie\\'s heart beat fast as he entered the hall. Again he was greeted by a chorus of welcomes from the company: \"Here comes Jamie Freel! welcome, welcome, Jamie!\"\\n \\nAs soon as the tumult subsided, the little woman said, \"You be to drink our health, Jamie, out o\\' this glass in my hand.\"\\n \\nJamie snatched the glass from her and darted to the door. He never knew how he reached his cabin, but he arrived there breathless, and sank on a stove by the fire.\\n \\n\"You\\'re kilt surely this time, my poor boy,\" said his mother.\\n \\n\"No, indeed, better luck than ever this time!\" and he gave the lady three drops of the liquid that still remained at the bottom of the glass, notwithstanding his mad race over the potato field.\\n \\nThe lady began to speak, and her first words were words of thanks to Jamie.\\n \\nThe three inmates of the cabin had so much to say to one another, that long after cock-crow, when the fairy music had quite ceased, they were talking round the fire.\\n \\n\"Jamie,\" said the lady, \"be pleased to get me paper and pen and ink, that I may write to my father, and tell him what has become of me.\"\\n \\nShe wrote, but weeks passed, and she received no answer. Again and again she wrote, and still no answer.\\n \\nAt length she said, \"You must come with me to Dublin, Jamie, to find my father.\"\\n \\n\"I ha\\' no money to hire a car for you,\" he replied, \"an\\' how can you travel to Dublin on your foot?\"\\n \\nBut she implored him so much that he consented to set out with her, and walk all the way from Fannet to Dublin. It was not as easy as the fairy journey; but at last they rang the bell at the door of the house in Stephen\\'s Green.\\n \\n\"Tell my father that his daughter is here,\" said she to the servant who opened the door.\\n \\n\"The gentleman that lives here has no daughter, my girl. He had one, but she died better nor a year ago.\"\\n \\n\"Do you not know me, Sullivan?\"\\n \\n\"No, poor girl, I do not.\"\\n \\n\"Let me see the gentleman. I only ask to see him.\"\\n \\n\"Well, that\\'s not much to ax; we\\'ll see what can be done.\"\\n \\nIn a few moments the lady\\'s father came to the door.\\n \\n\"Dear father,\" said she, \"don\\'t you know me?\"\\n \\n\"How dare you call me your father?\" cried the old gentleman, angrily. \"You are an impostor. I have no daughter.\"\\n \\n\"Look in my face, father, and surely you\\'ll remember me.\"\\n \\n\"My daughter is dead and buried. She died a long, long time ago.\" The old gentleman\\'s voice changed from anger to sorrow. \"You can go,\" he concluded.\\n \\n\"Stop, dear father, till you look at this ring on my finger. Look at your name and mine engraved on it.\"\\n \\n\"It certainly is my daughter\\'s ring; but I do not know how you came by it. I fear in no honest way.\"\\n \\n\"Call my mother, she will be sure to know me,\" said the poor girl, who, by this time, was crying bitterly.\\n \\n\"My poor wife is beginning to forget her sorrow. She seldom speaks of her daughter now. Why should I renew her grief by reminding her of her loss?\"\\n \\nBut the young lady persevered, till at last the mother was sent for.\\n \\n\"Mother,\" she began, when the old lady came to the door, \"don\\'t you know your daughter?\"\\n \\n\"I have no daughter; my daughter died and was buried a long, long time ago.\"\\n \\n\"Only look in my face, and surely you\\'ll know me.\"\\n \\nThe old lady shook her head.\\n\\n\"You have all forgotten me; but look at this mole on my neck. Surely, mother, you know me now?\"\\n \\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the mother, \" my Gracie had a mole on her neck like that; but then I saw her in her coffin, and saw the lid shut down upon her.\"\\n \\nIt became Jamie\\'s turn to speak, and he gave the history of the fairy journey, of the theft of the young lady, of the figure he had seen laid in its place, of her life with his mother in Fannet, of last Halloween, and of the three drops that had released her from her enchantment.\\n \\nShe took up the story when he paused, and told how kind the mother and son had been to her.\\n \\nThe parents could not make enough of Jamie. They treated him with every distinction, and when he expressed his wish to return to Fannet, said they did not know what to do to show their gratitude.\\n \\nBut an awkward complication arose. The daughter would not let him go without her. \"If Jamie goes, I\\'ll go too,\" she said. \"He saved me from the fairies, and has worked for me ever since. If it had not been for him, dear father and mother, you would never have seen me again. If he goes, I\\'ll go too.\"\\n \\nThis being her resolution, the old gentleman said that Jamie should become his son-in-law. The mother was brought from Fannet in a coach and four, and there was a splendid wedding.\\n \\nThey all lived together in the grand Dublin house, and Jamie was heir to untold wealth at his father-in-law\\'s death.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

These are spirited away by enchantment to his fairy palace at Knockma in Tuam, where they remain under a fairy spell, forgetting all about the earthly life and soothed to passive enjoyment, as in a sweet dream, by the soft low melody of the fairy music, which has the power to lull the hearer into a trance of ecstasy.\\n\\nThere was once a great lord in that part of the country who had a beautiful wife called Ethna, the loveliest bride in all the land. And her husband was so proud of her that day after day he had festivals in her honour; and from morning till night his castle was filled with lords and ladies, and nothing but music and dancing and feasting and hunting and pleasure was thought of.\\n\\nOne evening while the feast was merriest, and Ethna floated through the dance in her robe of silver gossamer clasped with jewels, more bright and beautiful than the stars in heaven, she suddenly let go the hand of her partner and sank to the floor in a faint.\\n\\nThey carried her to her room, where she lay long quite insensible; but towards the morning she woke up and declared that she had passed the night in a beautiful palace, and was so happy that she longed to sleep again and go there in her dreams. And they watched by her all day, but when the shades of evening fell dark on the castle, low music was heard at her window, and Ethna again fell into a deep trance from which nothing could rouse her.\\n\\nThen her old nurse was set to watch her; but the woman grew weary in the silence and fell asleep, and never awoke till the sun had risen. And when she looked towards the bed, she saw to her horror that the young bride had disappeared. The whole household was roused up at once, and search made everywhere, but no trace of her could be found in all the castle, nor in the gardens, nor in the park. Her husband sent messengers in every direction, but to no purpose -- no one had seen her; no sign of her could be found, living or dead.\\n\\nThen the young lord mounted his swiftest steed and galloped right off to Knockma, to question Finvarra, the fairy king, if he could give any tidings of the bride, or direct him where to search for her; for he and Finvarra were friends, and many a good keg of Spanish wine had been left outside the window of the castle at night for the fairies to carry away, by order of the young lord. But he little dreamed now that Finvarra himself was the traitor; so he galloped on like mad till he reached Knockma, the hill of the fairies.\\n\\nAnd as he stopped to rest his horse by the fairy rath, he heard voices in the air above him, and one said, \"Right glad is Finvarra now, for he has the beautiful bride in his palace at last; and never more will she see her husband\\'s face.\"\\n\\n\"Yet,\" answered another, \"if he dig down through the hill to the centre of the earth, he would find his bride; but the work is hard and the way is difficult, and Finvarra has more power than any mortal man.\"\\n\\n\"That is yet to be seen,\" exclaimed the young lord. \"Neither fairy, nor devil, nor Finvarra himself shall stand between me and my fair young wife;\" and on the instant he sent word by his servants to gather together all the workmen and labourers of the country round with their spades and pickaxes, to dig through the hill till they came to the fairy palace.\\n\\nAnd the workmen came, a great crowd of them, and they dug through the hill all that day till a great deep trench was made down to the very centre. Then at sunset they left off for the night; but next morning when they assembled again to continue their work, behold, all the clay was put back again into the trench, and the hill looked as if never a spade had touched it -- for so Finvarra had ordered; and he was powerful over earth and air and sea.\\n\\nBut the young lord had a brave heart, and he made the men go on with the work; and the trench was dug again, wide and deep into the centre of the hill. And this went on for three days, but always with the same result, for the clay was put back again each night and the hill looked the same as before, and they were no nearer to the fairy palace.\\n\\nThen the young lord was ready to die for rage and grief, but suddenly he heard a voice near him like a whisper in the air, and the words it said were these: \\n\"Sprinkle the earth you have dug up with salt, and your work will be safe.\"\\n\\nOn this new life came into his heart, and lie sent word through all the country to gather salt from the people; and the clay was sprinkled with it that night, when the men had left off their work at the hill.\\n\\nNext morning they all rose up early in great anxiety to see what had happened, and there to their great joy was the trench all safe, just as they had left it, and all the earth round it was untouched.\\n\\nThen the young lord knew he had power over Finvarra, and he bade the men work on with a good heart, for they would soon reach the fairy palace now in the centre of the hill. So by the next day a great glen was cut right through deep down to the middle of the earth, and they could hear the fairy music if they put their ear close to the ground, and voices were heard round them in the air.\\n\\n\"See now,\" said one, \"Finvarra is sad, for if one of those mortal men strike a blow on the fairy palace with their spades, it will crumble to dust, and fade away like the mist.\"\\n\\n\"Then let Finvarra give up the bride,\" said another, \"and we shall be safe.\"\\n\\nOn which the voice of Finvarra himself was heard, clear like the note of a silver bugle through the hill. \"Stop your work,\" he said. \"Oh, men of earth, lay down your spades, and at sunset the bride shall be given back to her husband. I, Finvarra, have spoken.\"\\n\\nThen the young lord bade them stop the work, and lay down their spades till the sun went down. And at sunset he mounted his great chestnut steed and rode to the head of the glen, and watched and waited; and just as the red light flushed all the sky, lie saw his wife coming along the path in her robe of silver gossamer, more beautiful than ever; and he sprang from the saddle and lifted her up before him, and rode away like the storm wind back to the castle. And there they laid Ethna on her bed; but she closed her eyes and spake no word. So day after day passed, and still she never spake or smiled, but seemed like one in a trance.\\n\\nAnd great sorrow fell upon every one, for they feared she had eaten of the fairy food, and that the enchantment would never be btoken. So her husband was very miserable. But one evening as he was riding home late, he heard voices in the air, and one of them said, \"It is now a year and a day since the young lord brought home his beautiful wife from Finvarra; but what good is she to him? She is speechless and like one dead; for her spirit is with the fairies though her form is there beside him.\"\\n\\nThen another voice answered, \"And so she will remain unless the spell is broken. He must unloose the girdle from her waist that is fastened with an enchanted pin, and burn the girdle with fire, and throw the ashes before the door, and bury the enchanted pin in the earth; then will her spirit come back from Fairyland, and she will once more speak and have true life.\"\\n\\nHearing this the young lord at once set spurs to his horse, and on reaching the castle hastened to the room where Ethna lay on her couch silent and beautiful like a waxen figure. Then, being determined to test the truth of the spirit voices, he untied the girdle, and after much difficulty extracted the enchanted pin from the folds. But still Ethna spoke no word; then he took the girdle and burned it with fire, and strewed the ashes before the door, and he buried the enchanted pin in a deep hole in the earth, under a fairy thorn, that no hand might disturb the spot. After which he returned to his young wife, who smiled as she looked at him, aud held forth her hand. Great was his joy to see the soul coming back to the beautiful form, and he raised her up and kissed her; and speech and memory came back to her at that moment, and all her former life, just as if it had never been broken or interrupted; but the year that her spirit had passed in Fairyland seemed to her but as a dream of the night, from which she had just awoke.\\n\\nAfter this Finvarra made no further efforts to carry her off; but the deep cut in the hill remains to this day, and is called \"The Fairy\\'s Glen.\" So no one can doubt the truth of the story as here narrated. \\n\\n',\n",

Requesting him to depart, they politely offered him the choice of three means of locomotion, viz., being carried off by a \"high wind, middle wind, or low wind.\" The jockey soon made up his mind, and elected to make his trip through the air by the assistance of a high wind.  \\nNo sooner had he given his decision, than he found himself whisked high up into the air, and his senses completely bewildered by the rapidity of his flight; he did not recover himself again till he came in contact with the earth, being suddenly dropped in the middle of a garden near Ty Gough, on the Bryndu Road, many miles distant from the spot whence he started on his aerial journey.  \\nNed, when relating this story, would vouch for its genuineness in the most solemn manner, and the person who narrated it to the writer brought forward, as a proof of its truth, \"that there was not the slightest trace of any person going into the garden while Ned was found in the middle of it.\"  \\nThe ultimate fate of the hero of the above incident was extremely melancholy. Returning home inebriated one night, he appears to have mistaken his road, and walked into the Severn, just below the Long Bridge, where his body was found next morning. \\n\\n',\n",

One day he was crossing the mountains to a fair, and when he got to a lonely valley he sat down, for he was tired, and he dropped off to sleep, and his bag fell down by his side. When he was sound asleep the fairies came and carried him off, bag and all, and took him under the earth, and when he awoke he found himself in a great palace of gold, full of fairies dancing and singing. And they took him and showed him everything, the splendid gold room and gardens, and they kept dancing round him until he fell asleep.\\n\\nWhen he was asleep they carried him back to the same spot where they had found him, and when he awoke he thought he had been dreaming, so he looked for his bag, and got hold of it, but he could hardly lift it.

Soon there fell upon him a certain charm, which made everything around him strange to him, and he found himself in one of the most beautiful countries he had ever seen, where everyone spent his time in nothing but joy and mirth. He had been there for seven years, and yet everything was but as a dream of the night; but he remembered the message on which he had set out, and his heart longed for his sweetheart.

Thus a Kirk Andreas man was absent from his people for four years, which he spent with the fairies. He could not tell how he returned, but it seemed as if, having been unconscious, he woke up at last in this world. The other world, however, in which he was for the four years was not far away, as he could see what his brothers and the rest of the family were doing every day, although they could not see him. \\n \\nTo prove this, he mentioned to them how they were occupied on such and such a day, and, among other things, how they took their corn on a particular day to Ramsey. He reminded them also of their having heard a sudden sharp crack as they were passing by a thorn bush he named, and how they were so startled that one of them would have run back home. He asked them if they remembered that, and they said they did, only too well. He then explained to them the meaning of the noise, namely, that one of the fairies with whom he had been galloping the whole time was about to let fly an arrow at his brothers, but that as he was going to do this, he (the missing brother) raised a plate and intercepted the arrow: that was the sharp noise they had heard. \\n\\nSuch was the account he had to give of his sojourn in Faery. \\n\\n',\n",

All the stories agree in referring the abduction of the child to supernatural agency, and in some cases it is referred to the \"Small People or Piskies,\" -- in others to less amiable spiritual creatures. \\n \\nMr. Hals [See Davies Gilbert\\'s Parochial History of Cornwall] has given one version of this story, which differs in some respects from the tale as I heard it, from an old woman some thirty years since, who then lived in this parish. Her tale was to the following effect. \\n \\nIt was a lovely evening, and the little boy was gathering flowers in the fields, near a wood. The child was charmed by hearing some beautiful music, which he at first mistook for the song of birds; but, being a sharp boy, he was not long deceived, and he went towards the wood to ascertain from whence the melodious sounds came. When he reached the verge of the wood, the music was of so exquisite a character, that he was compelled to follow the sound, which appeared to travel before him. Lured in this way, the boy penetrated to the dark center of the grove, and here, meeting with some difficulties, owing to the thick growth of underwood, he paused, and began to think of returning. The music, however, became more ravishing than before, and some invisible being appeared to crush down all the low and tangled plants, thus forming for him a passage, over which he passed without any difficulty. \\n \\nAt length he found himself on the edge of a small lake, and, greatly to his astonishment, the darkness of night was around him, but the heavens were thick with stars. The music ceased, and, wearied with his wanderings, the boy fell asleep on a bed of ferns. \\n\\nHe related, on his restoration to his parents, that he was taken by a beautiful lady through palaces of the most gorgeous description. Pillars of glass supported arches which glistened with every color, and these were hung with crystals far exceeding anything which were ever seen in the caverns of a Cornish mine. It is, however, stated that many days passed away before the child was found by his friends, and that at length he was discovered one lovely morning sleeping on the bed of ferns, on which he was supposed to have fallen asleep on the first adventurous evening.\\n\\nThere was no reason given by the narrator why the boy was \"spirited away\" in the first instance, or why he was returned. Her impression was, that some sprites, pleased with the child\\'s innocence and beauty, had entranced him. That when asleep he had been carried through the waters to the fairy abodes beneath them; and she felt assured that a child so treated would be kept under the especial guardianship of the sprites for ever afterwards. Of this, however, tradition leaves us in ignorance.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The fairies dropped their booty, which proved to\\nbe a Sassenach (English) lady whom the dwellers of Shian of Coir-laggac\\nhad carried away from her own country, leaving a stock in her place which,\\nof course, died and was buried. \\nJohn brought her home, and she lived for many years in his house.\\n\"It happened, however, in the course of time,\" said the Gaelic\\nnarrator, \"that the new king found it necessary to make the great\\nroads through these countries by means of soldiers, for the purpose of\\nletting coaches and carriages pass to the northern cities; and those\\nsoldiers had officers and commanders in the same way as our fighting army\\nhave now. Those soldiers were never great favorites in these countries,\\nparticularly during the time that our kings were alive; and consequently\\nit was no easy matter for them, either officers or men, to procure for\\nthemselves comfortable quarters.\"\\nBut John Roy would not keep up the national animosity to the cottan\\ndearg (red-coats), and he offered a residence in his house to a\\nSaxon captain and his son. When there they could not take their\\neyes off the English lady, and the son remarked to his father what a\\nstrong likeness she bore to his deceased mother.\\nThe father replied that he too had been struck with the resemblance,\\nand said he could almost fancy she was his wife. He then mentioned\\nher name and those of some persons connected with them. The lady by these\\nwords at once recognized her husband and son, and honest John Roy had the\\nsatisfaction of reuniting the long-separated husband and wife, and\\nreceiving their most grateful acknowledgments.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

After playing for some considerable time he was allowed to depart, and immediately proceeded homewards. When he came to his house, however, he saw with amazement that the roof was off, the walls decayed and crumbling into ruins, and the floor grown over with rank grass. He questioned the neighbors, but they were utter strangers to him and could cast no glimmer of light on the remarkable situation. The place had been in that ruinous condition all their time, they said. He sought out the oldest inhabitant, but even he had no recollection of anyone staying in the place, but he did remember hearing a tale to the effect that at one time the guidman [master] of that house had mysteriously disappeared, and never returned. It was commonly supposed that the hill-folk had taken him. \\n\\nThe fiddler, of course, knew no one, and had nowhere to go, and when the old man asked him to spend the night at his house, he very gladly accepted the invitation. It so happened that the following day was Sacrament Sunday, and they both went to church. The fiddler asked to be permitted to communicate. This request was granted, but no sooner did he touch the \"elements\" [bread and wine of the Eucharist] than he crumbled into dust. \\n\\n\\n',\n",

On reaching the mount, she saw that it was standing on red pillars, and at the same moment an elf came and presented to her a cup of wine. She took the cup, and having emptied it, suffered herself to join in a dance.  \\nWhen the dance was ended she bethought herself of her husband and hastened home. Here it appeared to her that everything in and about the place was changed, and on entering the village, she recognized neither house nor farm, and heard nothing of the noisy mirth of the wedding. At length she found herself standing before her husband\\'s dwelling, but on entering saw no one whom she knew, and no one who knew her.  \\nOne old woman only, on hearing the bride\\'s lamentation, exclaimed, \"Is it then you, who a hundred years ago disappeared at my grandfather\\'s brother\\'s wedding?\"  \\nAt these words the aged bride fell down and instantly expired. \\n\\n',\n",

After they had gone to bed, \\nand while they were yet awake, they saw a white, dew-besprinkled woman\\'s \\nhand reaching in through the door. They well understood that their visitor \\nwas a sea nymph, who sought their destruction, and feigned unconsciousness \\nof her presence.  \\nThe following day their number was added to by the coming of a young, \\ncourageous and newly married man from Kinnar, in Lummelund. When they \\nrelated to him their adventure of the night before, he made fun of their \\nbeing afraid to take a beautiful woman by the hand, and boasted that if he \\nhad been present he would not have neglected to grasp the proffered hand. \\n \\nThat evening when they laid themselves down in the same room, the late \\narrival with them, the door opened again, and a plump, white woman\\'s arm, \\nwith a most beautiful hand, reached in over the sleepers.  \\nThe young man arose from his bed, approached the door and seized the \\noutstretched hand, impelled, perhaps, more by the fear of his comrades \\nscoffing at his boasted bravery, than by any desire for a closer \\nacquaintance with the strange visitor. \\nImmediately his comrades witnessed him drawn noiselessly out through the \\ndoor, which closed softly after him. They thought he would return soon, \\nbut when morning approached and he did not appear, they set out in search \\nof him. Far and near the search was pursued, but without success. His \\ndisappearance was complete.  \\nThree years passed and nothing had been heard of the missing man. His \\nyoung wife, who had mourned him all this time as dead, was finally \\npersuaded to marry another. On the evening of the wedding day, while the \\nmirth was at its highest, a stranger entered the cottage. Upon closer \\nobservation some of the guests thought they recognized the bride\\'s former \\nhusband.  \\nThe utmost surprise and commotion followed.  \\nIn answer to the inquiries of those present as to where he came from and \\nwhere he had been, he related that it was a sea nymph whose hand he had \\ntaken that night when he left the fisherman\\'s hut; and that he was dragged \\nby her down into the sea. In her pearly halls he forgot his wife, parents, \\nand all that was loved by him until the morning of that day, when the sea \\nnymph exclaimed, \"There will be a dusting out in Kinnar this evening.\"  \\nThen his senses immediately returned, and, with anxiety, he asked, \"Then \\nit is my wife who is to be the bride?\"  \\nThe sea nymph replied in the affirmative.  \\nAt his urgent request, she allowed him to come up to see his wife as a \\nbride, stipulating that when he arrived at the house he should not enter. \\nWhen he came and saw her adorned with garland and crown he could, \\nnevertheless, not resist the desire to enter. Then came a tempest and took \\naway half the roof of the house, whereupon the man fell sick and three \\ndays later died. \\n\\n',\n",
