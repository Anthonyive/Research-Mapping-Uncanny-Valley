I don't know how often I will be able to post on this, or if I'll be lucky enough to do so again.  I don't know whether I will be alive to finish this. All I know is that I could die. I don't understand exactly how I know that I could die. But the feeling won't leave my chest, every night it is like I'm being ripped apart slowly,  first my stomach will hurt, then it will feel as if someone or something is ripping my ribs off my body one by one. Every night I feel like it will be my last. Every night I think I will die. But then I wake up.\\nMy name is Lucy Roberts,  I'm a professor at Lincoln university in England. I'm 29 years old,  I was born 11/5/1990. The only reason why I'm telling you this is because it means that if I die you can find out who I was. I don't want to focus on here exactly who I was, what life I've lived. But I'll let you know I'm a terrible person. Alot of people have gotten hurt because of me and I'm not proud of the life I've lived so far. But maybe I can redeem myself by warning anyone reading this. If I could help or save just one person, I'd happily except what is lurking in the dark. \\nI don't know how many entries this will have but then again I know when this torment will end.Maybe I should recount the people I've hurt before talking about the dark! I was always scared of the dark, since being a little kid.\\n\\nThe first person who I hurt was my childhood friend. Every since I was a kid I wanted to teach and help people and so did she. You don't need a description of her. She looked like a typical eleven year old girl, she had blonde hair, fair skin and brown eyes. I always envied her for having blonde hair, it was curly and shined.  My hair was brown and and thin. It wasn't even a nice brown, my mother described it like a rodents fur. Her name was Ellen, she joined my class in 2000, she was one of the oldest in the class and instantly she came to join me. I guess it was only because there was a seat next to me and no where else. It wasn't that I didn't have friends, I'd just rather keep my head in a book. She turned that around. We talked, bonded and spoke fondly of wanting to be teachers. She wanted to teach little kids and I wanted to teach older kids. We'd play as teachers nearly every day. It was really sweet. \\n\\nEllen and I stayed friends for a few months,  I thought she was amazing. Someone I could trust and grow with. Then the accident happened. It happened on the 10th of August 2000, we were walking home together,  our neighborhood was a safe place so it was common for us to walk home at our age. We were talking,  laughing and having fun as we walked. Ellen had just gotten a new bag, it was beautiful,  it was a soft pink and felt so nice to touch. It was expensive, I can't remember what brand it was but at the time we all envied it, I did too. My bag was old,  ripped and was grey.  It used to be purple but I had it so long that it went a murky grey colour. I begged for a bag but mother told me to he greatfull. Ellen boasted about the bag, she knew that my mother was strict on buying new things,  she would jab at me some times about it. This time I got really angry by it. \\nI don't remember what happened, but Ellen ended up sprawled out on the ground. I remember she was pale, her eyes had no more shine and her hair went dirty and red from the blood leaking out of her head. A car hit her. I didn't know how to react. Before I could see much of her mangled body a bystander had pulled me away yelling and calling for a ambulance. I had her on the phone, she was talking quickly and steadily about Ellen. Apparently her arms were bent and contorted unnaturally and her left leg was spewing with blood. I don't know if I pushed her. That part was always fuzzy to me. I would remember sometimes that we were having a silly argument about her bag and then the next thing I knew she was on the floor dead. \\nThe man driving the car was sentenced was given fourteen years in prison. People believe he wasn't paying attention. He got so much hate, people swarmed the court to attack him. I felt bad for him. His life was ruined and I couldn't remember if it was my fault. I remember my mother on the phone talking about how only a week after being in the prison,  he killed himself by hanging in his cell out of guilt. \\n\\nThat was the first time that the dark seemed scary to me. Some kind of uncomfortable feeling started. It made me feel ill. That was the first time that I thought I would die.</th>\n",

       "      <th rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\">“Hi, uh, I’m Rob and I was wondering if you are in need of a pest control service.”\\n\\nI stared at the man standing on my front porch, wanting nothing more than to slam the door in his face.\\n\\n“We do free inspections and our prices are reasonable. Are you interested?”\\n\\nI have always hated door-to-door salesmen. It took all of my willpower to muster a polite “no thanks.”\\n\\n“Ok, well, here’s my business card, and you can always call if you change your mind. We’re currently offering a 10% discount to all first-time customers. If you ever find a pest - anything from ants to alligators - let me know and we can get them removed as quickly as possible.”\\n\\nWith that, I closed the door and went back to watching TV. A couple minutes later, there was another knock at my front door. Feeling irritated, I looked through the peephole and saw Rob staring back at me. After contemplating what to do, I threw open the door and started yelling.\\n\\n“What do you wa-“\\n\\nHe wasn’t there anymore, and I saw his truck speeding into the distance. He must have moved fast to get to his truck that quickly. Almost impossibly fast. I looked down and noticed that there was an ant starting to crawl through the doorway. I stepped on it.\\n\\n*What a dumbass,* I thought to myself, *thinking that putting a single ant on my doorstep would scare me into giving him my money.* I shut the door and once again resumed the movie I was watching.\\n\\nLater that day I took my dogs for a walk. I opened the door and watched the two of them - a German shepherd and a husky - stop dead in their tracks and refuse to go outside the door. I looked at the front porch and saw a scorpion staring back at me. I slammed the door shut and left the house through the garage.\\n\\nDown the road I noticed that Rob had parked his truck in front of a different house. After seeing him walking towards someone’s front door, I called out to him, “Hey man, stop bothering people and go get a real job!”\\n\\nHe turned around and I was surprised to see that it wasn’t rob. Instead, I was looking at my neighbor, Phillip. I immediately regretted my choice of words and muttered something like “sorry, I was, uh, I thought you were someone else.” What makes it worse is that Phillip is a doctor.\\n\\nI got home and soon started getting ready to go to bed. I struggled to fall asleep because I couldn’t get rid of a tingly feeling in my legs. No matter how many times I told myself it was all in my head and I needed to get some sleep, the feeling persisted and I reluctantly turned on the light to prove to myself that nothing was there. The thing is, there was something there.\\n\\nIn my bed there were dozens of baby spiders crawling around. I screamed, my arachnophobia getting the better of me. I jumped out of bed and heard the sound of crying. Except, it wasn’t quite crying. It was whimpering.\\n\\nI rushed outside, but it was too late. Both of my dogs were laying still with knives in their heads. I noticed a note on the ground next to them.\\n\\n*Hello, since you are one of our more reluctant customers we are willing to increase our discount to 15%. It is highly recommended that you accept this offer. In addition, as proof of our terrific service, we have gotten rid of two pests that have been living in your house for years. You have 60 seconds to accept the offer or your house is going to become even more infested.*\\n\\nI grabbed my phone from the bedroom and called the cops. Before I had time to dial, though, I heard glass breaking from across the house. I grabbed a lamp and hid behind the door, hearing footsteps moving around the house before finally coming to a rest right outside my room. I decided not to wait, coming out from my hiding spot and hitting the intruder in the head with the lamp.\\n\\nHe fell to the ground and I saw that it was, as I had suspected, Rob. I called the police and reported a home invasion. While waiting for the police to arrive, I noticed a trail of ants leading to the back door. I walked into the kitchen and froze. I’ve been here for 20 minutes, waiting for something to happen. The cops still haven’t showed up.\\n\\nRob is on the ground dead in the hallway, so how is he standing outside my window smiling at [me?](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeping_gems/)\\n\\n[More stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/notathrowaway128/comments/gt6h1j/story_archive/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)</th>\n",

I could see the blood coursing through the weary veins, some of it was leaking onto the floor and was somehow beginning to surround the candles. \\n\\nI stood transfixed, something was happening to me. The scraping was getting closer and closer and I could feel a presence behind me but I couldn’t turn around. I willed myself with all my strength to turn around but I just couldn’t. I was utterly mesmerised by the heart, helpless. \\n\\nTears began to stream down my face when I felt something brush past my leg - a long single strand of grey hair. But I couldn’t see who it was, my eyes were fixed on the heart and I was unable to move them. \\n\\nWhat the hell was happening? I tried to speak but only a small whimper managed to escape my parched lips. Then...I saw her. \\n\\nAn old woman, limped slowly into view. She hobbled past me as if I wasn’t there straight over to the beating heart. It was a hideous sight.\\n\\nShe picked up the heart as I watched feebly and licked it - her elongated tongue grazed the majority of the heart. Blood began to trickle down her monstrous lips, all the way down her bulging neck. It was then that I saw her iron teeth. They were blackened, sharp and permanently stained by what looked like old speckles of blood. She bit into the heart, hard and started chewing. The noise, my god, the noise. I’d never heard anything like it. The crude smacking of her lips, the horrible crunching of the heart muscle was unbearable to my ears. \\n\\nShe suddenly stopped and looked at me, really saw me, like she didn’t properly see me until that moment. She looked deep into my eyes and it was then that I started to hear whispers, but I couldn’t make out anything tangible. It was a plethora of voices, all around me. \\n\\nBaba Yaga began to walk towards me, her deformed stance made even more horrific by the bulge that was her back. She clutched the heart in her blood covered claw, droplets of blood fell on the floor. \\n\\nI was still immobilised to the spot by whatever trance she put me in. I could do nothing. \\n\\nShe got so close to me that I could smell the foul air that permeated from her body, her mouth. She held the heart in front of me, in front of my face, she held it so close that I could smell the familiar scent of blood, a metallic smell. \\nShe smeared the bloody heart all over my face. I couldn’t even scream, I was completely incapacitated. Some of it got into my mouth. \\n\\nShe cackled then and dropped the heart to the floor, where it melted. She looked at me and whispered. \\n\\n‘’You are mine now’’\\n\\nThen she was gone and I fell to the ground, my breathing was erratic and I passed out. \\n\\nI awoke a short while later, utterly dazed and I could barely see anything in front of me. When my vision settled a little, I looked at my hands and they were completely covered in blood, the blood dripped from my fingers onto my legs and that was when I saw a puddle of deep red. My vision was still somewhat blurry but I thought I could make out a body laying on the floor a few feet in front of me. I looked all around me and panicked, I wasn’t on the landing anymore. I was in a red room. \\n\\nThere were no doors and no windows and it was just me and the still body. Candles lined the perimeters of the room and nothing else was there. Next to the body, a little further away, lay a book. A different one. \\n\\nI was too far away to see it clearly but I knew it wasn’t mine because mine was laying right next to me. I stood up slowly, unsure of my balance but my legs held. I wiped my hands and began walking over to the body, to the book, my body completely over taken by fear, my mind raced. I just didn’t know what to do, how to get out. For once in my life, I really just wished that I’d stayed in my bedroom. Maybe my parents did all of this to protect me, to protect me from her. But my curiosity was going to get me killed...or worse. Why didn’t I just stay put. \\n\\nI moved over to the book, I wanted to avoid the body laying close by as much as possible but I knew I would have to look sooner or later. I shivered, tears began to form around my tired eyes and I wiped them away. \\n\\nWhen I edged closer, I saw the book was open. The writing was illegible to me, it was all in Russian but it appeared to be some kind of spell book. It contained strange symbols and speckles of blood covered some of the pages. There were drawings in this book that were inconceivable to me. Drawings of torn open human bodies, drawings of hooded figures with their hands covered in blood holding human organs. Drawings of horned creatures devouring babies and children. One drawing in particular, depicted the Baba Yaga surrounded by cloaked beings, all were kneeling around her in a circle. In front of her, was a cooking pot and one of the cloaked beings held a child in some sort of sacrificial stance. It was the most horrifying thing I’d ever seen, aside from Baba Yaga herself of course. I shut the book and threw it. \\n\\nAnother part of her story that I should mention is that people have tried and failed to vanquish her. The stories about her span centuries and she is believed to be one of the most allusive creatures ever encountered. She can be metaphorically shackled though, she can be trapped by those who summon her for their own gain. But even then, those who bind her with a spell like that always end up paying a high price for trapping Baba Yaga. For using her powers. \\nIn the stories I read, she terrorised villages that mistakenly summoned her or stumbled upon the disused hut that was supported by blood covered chicken legs in the middle of a deep and thick forest. A hut she inhabited. Where she ate the hearts of children and consumed their souls. No one was ever able to truly destroy her. Not in those stories. \\n\\nIt was hopeless and I was utterly helpless. I didn’t know how I was ever going to escape and I really wanted to find my parents, to find out what in the world was going on and why this was happening. Did they summon her? Was this their doing? Why? \\n\\nThe Baba Yaga never rests. Once she is summoned, she never truly goes away. She never leaves those who have encountered her, alone. \\n\\nI was crying when suddenly, the dead body twitched.</th>\n",

       "      <th>You always loved spending time with your older brother when you were both kids. You were both the only kids that lived in the area, and it was much, much better to be together than to be alone. You two always loved exploring in the woods nearby, playing games under the shade of the thick canopy, but your older brother was the more... adventurous of the two of you, always walking farther and farther into the woods every time. You never wanted to tag along with him, but you had to. It was better than being alone. \\n\\nOne day, when the two of you were particularly far into the woods, you found a little swingset. Your brother let out a triumphant cheer, glad the two of you had found something worthwhile so far into the woods. He smiled at you. \"Well,\" he said, putting his hand on your shoulder, \"now we have rhyme and reason to come to the woods!\" You smiled meekly, as you still rather preferred staying towards the edge of the woods. \\n\\n\"But, promise me this,\" he said, looking at you with a serious look in his eyes, \"never come out here alone, ok? It's too dark. You could get lost.\" You nodded vigorously, you didn't want to be out here by yourself! It was dark, damp, and the woods creaked in such an odd fashion you swore they were going to swallow you whole. You'd rather eat a whole plate of vegetables than be out here on your own. That swingset became a place of solitude for you and your brother. \\n\\nA place of peace, and of quiet- mostly. Every now and then, the branches would rustle, but in such a way you'd only assume it was the wind running across their leaves. It was fine. On one rather sunshiney day, when you and your brother were returning from the woods, he realized he had left his bag in the woods. It was an important bag, hs used it for school, but seeing as you were both on break, he carried more practical things in it, like bandages and his pocket knife. He ran to go fetch it, he swore it'd only take a minute. He told you to run on home, to tell mom he'd be back in time for supper. The police searched those woods for hours. They found no trace of your brother, only his bag he had run to collect. \\n\\nA spot of blood was on its exterior, but upon examinations, it turned out not to be his. The police were unsure of what the blood belonged to, but they held out hope that your brother was alive and well. When they released his bag back to your family for comfort, you disovered something to be missing. His pocket knife was gone. You were grown now, visiting your old childhood home and your parents on break- college left you stressed, and you wanted to be with something familiar. The swing set. You hasn't been there since the day your brother went missing. You told your mom you were going to run an errand, and in a way, you were. \\n\\nAs you strode into the woods, your walk became less confident as you went on. You were tiptoeing by the time you reached the swing. His seat on the swing had been broken in half, splintered and uneven, but yours was fine. A glint of metal caught your eye, sitting in the middle of what used to be your seat. It was his pocket knife. You shoved it in your jacket, and decided it was time to leave. Out of the corner of your eye, you saw a beast with a slash over its right eye. You shouldn't have come out here alone</th>\n",
